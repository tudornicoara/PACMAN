            <p>
                This page represents the architecture and the documentation of our web application that is further described in the following sections. It contains the functionalities, the usecases and some diagrams meant to show the guidelines that we want to follow in order to implement our application. The technologies used are presented at the 4th point of this page.
            </p>

            <h2> 2. Project description</h2>
            <p> Our application's aim is to create a pacman experience of our faculty (Faculty of Computer Science - Iasi). The opponents are characters created by the computer. The user will be represented based on his Facebook profile image. For every level of the game a new map will be rendered, spanning through a number of floors in the faculty. There will be offered coins and powerups in order to increase the score. In the map, there will be present some "ghosts" that will represent the teachers of the user. </p>

            <h3>Single Page Application</h3>
                <p> This is a Single Page Application, as it is loads a single HTML page and then dynamically updates it as the user interacts with it.</p>

            <h2> 4. Technologies</h2>
                <h3>Microdata</h3>
                    <p>
                        HTML5 Microdata is used by pairing the element tags with a specific HTML attribute meant to embed machine-readable data in our document. The search engines, browsers and web-crawlers will extract the microdata, all to provide a rich browsing experience for the users.
                    </p>
                <h3> Web Storage</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The credentials provided by the user are stored in localStorage, keeping in this way the user's data in the browser in the eventuality that he/she will want to remain logged in, in order to play the game. In this way, we can store more information rather than using cookies, without affecting the application's performance.
                    </p>
                <h3> HTML, CSS & JS</h3>
                    <p>
                        HTML, CSS and JS are used for implementing the design and the game core of our application.
                    </p>
                <h3> Firebase authenication</h3>
                <p>
                    Because our application needs to know the identity of the user to provide a customized experience, Firebase was used.
                </p>

                <h3> Node.js</h3>
                    <p>
                        Node.js is used for the server part. The server sends the entire page and after that, it won't need a network connection to make the most of the functionalities provided.
                    </p>
