                This page represents the architecture and the documentation of our web application that is further described in the following sections.

            <h2> 2. Project description</h2>
            <p> Our application's aim is to create a pacman experience of our faculty (Faculty of Computer Science - Iasi). The opponents are characters created by the computer. The user will be represented based on his Facebook profile image. For every level of the game a new map will be rendered, spanning through a number of floors in the faculty. There will be offered coins and powerups in order to increase the score. In the map, there will be present some "ghosts" that will represent the teachers of the user. </p>
